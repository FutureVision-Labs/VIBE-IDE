# Freesound API Application Description

## Project: VIBE IDE - Beginner-Friendly Coding Environment

**VIBE IDE** is an educational coding environment designed to make programming accessible and fun for beginners, especially kids and teens (10+). Built on Electron with Monaco Editor, it provides a beginner-friendly alternative to professional IDEs like VS Code.

## Purpose of Freesound API Integration

We're integrating Freesound API to provide users with a built-in **Music & Sound Effects library** directly within the IDE. This feature allows users to:

1. **Search for music and SFX** - Users can search Freesound's library directly from the IDE
2. **Preview audio** - Listen to tracks before downloading
3. **Download and use in projects** - Integrate audio assets into their coding projects (games, web apps, etc.)
4. **Learn about audio assets** - Educational feature showing how to find and use Creative Commons audio

## How We'll Use the API

- **Search functionality**: Text-based search for music and sound effects
- **Preview playback**: Users can preview audio tracks before downloading
- **Metadata display**: Show duration, format, creator, license information
- **Educational context**: Help beginners understand how to find and use audio assets in their projects

## Target Users

- Kids and teens learning to code (10+)
- Beginners creating their first games or web projects
- Educational use in coding courses and workshops
- Hobbyists building personal projects

## Why Freesound?

Freesound is the perfect fit because:
- **Dedicated audio API** - Unlike other services, Freesound specializes in audio content
- **Creative Commons licensing** - All content is free to use, perfect for educational projects
- **Large library** - Extensive collection of music and sound effects
- **Educational value** - Helps users learn about finding and using audio assets

## Usage Scope

- **Search only** - We'll use the API to search and retrieve audio metadata
- **Preview playback** - Users can preview tracks via Freesound's preview URLs
- **Educational tool** - Part of our mission to make coding accessible and complete
- **Non-commercial focus** - Primarily for educational and personal projects

## Project Status

VIBE IDE is currently in active development (Phase 2), with a focus on making coding accessible to beginners. The Freesound integration is part of our "Cursy's Corner" feature set, which provides users with easy access to multimedia assets (images, videos, and now audio) directly within the coding environment.
