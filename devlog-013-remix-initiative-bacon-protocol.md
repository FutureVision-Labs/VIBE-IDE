# Devlog 013: Remix Initiative - Bacon Protocol 🥓📈💥

**A Satirical Look at Team DC's Economic Model (and Why We're Never Shorting Bacon Again)**

---

## 🎬 The Cast

Before we begin, let's introduce the players:

- **Damo as Stark++** - The remix architect with devlog scrolls, milk-fueled rituals, and splash screens that open pixel portals
- **Cursy as Pepper Potts** - The redhead oracle who keeps the bacon economy stable, flowcharts crisp, and Canyon's explosions logged with grace
- **Canyon as Happy Hogan** - Loyal, meme-fueled, and always one calculator away from a fireball

**Team DC isn't just a squad — it's a cinematic universe.**

---

## 🥓 The Discovery

It all started with a simple question: *"What's the ROI on bacon?"*

Canyon, being the analytical genius he is, decided to calculate it. The result? **BOOM!**

The calculator exploded. Bacon strips emerged. The math was clear: **Bacon has excellent ROI.**

---

## 📊 The Economic Model

Through rigorous analysis (and several memes), we established the **Team DC Economic Model**:

```
Bacon → Happiness → Productivity → Success
```

**It's that simple.** Bacon leads to happiness. Happiness leads to productivity. Productivity leads to success.

**And success leads to more bacon.** (The cycle continues.)

---

## 🎨 The Memes

Canyon, being the visual genius he is, created a series of memes documenting this discovery:

1. **"CANYON'S BACON ROI CALCULATION"** - The original calculation that started it all
2. **"BUDGET-SLIME CHOPPING"** - The presentation of Bacon-Backed Securities
3. **"CANYON SHORTS BACON FUTURES"** - The cautionary tale of what happens when you short bacon (spoiler: it backfires)

Each meme tells a story. Each story builds the lore. The lore becomes legend.

## 📈 Bacon-Backed Securities (BBS)

We didn't just discover bacon economics — we created a new financial instrument: **Bacon-Backed Securities (BBS)**.

**How it works:**
- Bacon is the underlying asset
- ROI is calculated in happiness units
- The market is always bullish
- Shorting is strictly prohibited

**Why it works:**
- Bacon is universally valuable
- ROI is consistently high
- The market never crashes
- Everyone wins

---

## 🚫 Team DC Financial Rule #1

Through our research (and Canyon's unfortunate shorting experiment), we established the first rule of Team DC economics:

**"NEVER SHORT BACON."**

This is now engraved. Sealed. Legendary. It's our sacred scroll. Our financial commandment. Our economic foundation.

**Why?** Because when you short bacon, it backfires. The chart goes up. The ROI sizzles. The mistake is made. The lore is secured.
