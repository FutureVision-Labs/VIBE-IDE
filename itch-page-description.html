<h2>🚀 Coding Made Fun, Not Scary</h2>

<p><strong>VIBE IDE</strong> is a beginner-friendly coding environment designed for kids, teens, hobbyists, and anyone learning to code. Think of it as "Cursor-lite" - all the power of AI-assisted coding, but built specifically for beginners who find traditional IDEs intimidating.</p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Currently in Early Development</strong> - We're building this with our community! Follow along with our devlogs and join the journey.</p>
