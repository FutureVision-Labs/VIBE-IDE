# VIBE IDE - Early Access

## 🚀 Coding Made Fun, Not Scary

**VIBE IDE** is a beginner-friendly coding environment designed for kids, teens, hobbyists, and anyone learning to code. Think of it as "Cursor-lite" - all the power of AI-assisted coding, but built specifically for beginners who find traditional IDEs intimidating.

## 🛠️ Built on Solid Foundations

VIBE IDE is built on the **GameForge IDE Alpha** codebase, which provides:

We've evolved it from a Phaser.js-exclusive game dev tool into a multi-language, educational coding environment for beginners.
